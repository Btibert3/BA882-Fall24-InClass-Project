year = 2023
producer_id = 'ABC01'
```

Thank you for participating in our `{python} year` project!

> default value year, not producer id


quarto render report4.qmd -P year:2025 -P producer_id:BROCK1

had to use base environment, not my project one, install papermill with `pip install papermill` and it worked.  its like quarto doesnt respect the environment, even though some docs troubleshooting this issue suggest it does.
